# ROI-Focused Development Prompts

This library contains prompts designed to maximize ROI in our development process by:

1. Prioritizing work with the highest value impact
2. Systematically resolving errors in order of business importance
3. Enforcing consistent quality standards
4. Providing templates that accelerate development

## How to Use These Prompts with GitHub Copilot

In VS Code, you can use these prompts by:

1. Opening the GitHub Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. Referencing a specific prompt file, e.g.: "Apply the guidelines from roi-principles.md to this code"
3. Using context-specific templates, e.g.: "Create a new API endpoint following our template"
