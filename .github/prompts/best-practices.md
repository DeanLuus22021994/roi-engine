# Best Practices for MinimalReactMariaDB

## Architecture
- Follow clean architecture principles separating UI, business logic, and data layers
- Use React functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement container/presentational component pattern for better separation of concerns

## Code Style
- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Follow airbnb style guide for JavaScript/React
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components)

## Performance
- Implement React.memo for expensive rendering components
- Use useCallback and useMemo hooks for optimizing performance
- Implement proper database indexing for MariaDB queries

## Security
- Sanitize all user inputs before database operations
- Implement proper authentication with JWT tokens
- Use prepared statements for database queries to prevent SQL injection
- Set up proper CORS policies

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all utility functions
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage

## Development Workflow
- Use feature branches with descriptive names
- Write meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Perform code reviews before merging PRs
- Automate testing and deployment with CI/CD pipelines
