# Development Flow Guide

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the development environment
3. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`
4. Access MariaDB at `localhost:3306`

## Development Cycle
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**
   - Follow project architecture patterns
   - Write tests alongside code
   - Document complex logic with comments

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   npm test
   
   # Run linting
   npm run lint
   
   # Start development server
   npm start
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   # Follow conventional commits format
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with component"
   git commit -m "refactor: improve code structure"
   git commit -m "docs: update README with new instructions"
   git commit -m "test: add tests for new feature"
   ```

5. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Push changes to remote repository
   - Create PR with descriptive title and detailed description
   - Reference related issues
   - Request code review from team members

6. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
   - Address review comments
   - Update tests as needed
   - Push additional commits to the same feature branch

7. **Merge and Deploy**
   - Merge PR once approved
   - Delete feature branch
   - CI/CD pipeline will handle deployment
