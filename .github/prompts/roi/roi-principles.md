# ROI Principles for Development

## Core ROI Principles

1. **Measurable Value**: All development work should have clearly defined, measurable value outcomes.
2. **Error Convergence**: Prioritize fixing errors that affect users, revenue, or system stability.
3. **Enhancement Divergence**: Identify and pursue enhancements that maximize user value and business impact.
4. **Time-to-Value Ratio**: Minimize the time between investment (development effort) and return (business value).
5. **Systematic Resolution**: Address issues according to their ROI impact, not just their technical severity.

## ROI Calculation Formula

ROI = (Value Generated - Development Cost) / Development Cost * 100%

Where:

- **Value Generated** includes:
  - Revenue impact
  - Cost savings
  - User satisfaction improvement
  - Technical debt reduction
  - Risk mitigation
- **Development Cost** includes:
  - Engineering time
  - Testing resources
  - Opportunity cost
  - Operational overhead

## Decision Framework

When evaluating any development task, ask:

1. What is the expected ROI of this task?
2. How quickly will it generate value?
3. What is the confidence level in our ROI estimate?
4. Does it converge on resolving critical errors or diverge toward valuable enhancements?
5. Could the same resources generate higher ROI elsewhere?
