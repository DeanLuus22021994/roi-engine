# ROI Optimization Guidelines

## Core Principles

- All feature development should have associated ROI analysis
- Real-time monitoring should feed back into ROI calculations
- Prioritize work with highest adjusted priority score
- Regular retrospectives should compare estimated vs. actual ROI

## Workflow Integration

1. **Planning Phase**
   - Create ROI analysis for each proposed feature
   - Establish measurable success metrics
   - Set thresholds for acceptable ROI

2. **Development Phase**
   - Track time investment in real-time
   - Update ROI projections as requirements change
   - Link commits to specific ROI analysis IDs

3. **Deployment Phase**
   - Monitor performance metrics and error rates
   - Correlate user behavior with feature usage
   - Automatically update ROI calculations based on real-world data

4. **Retrospective Phase**
   - Compare projected vs. actual ROI
   - Document learnings to improve future estimates
   - Identify patterns in successful vs. unsuccessful features

## Decision-Making Framework

- Features with priority score < 40 require additional justification
- Technical debt work should include long-term ROI impact
- Error resolution priority should correlate with user impact * revenue impact

## Reporting Standards

- Weekly ROI dashboard review with development team
- Monthly ROI retrospective with stakeholders
- Quarterly strategic alignment of ROI targets with business goals

## Continuous Improvement

- Refine estimation models based on historical accuracy
- Evolve priority scoring algorithm as business priorities shift
- Automate increasingly more aspects of ROI tracking
