# Real-Time Context Awareness System

This system provides self-evaluation and retrospective best practices for your codebase, focusing on:
- Error convergence (quick resolution of issues)
- Enhancement divergence (identification of improvement opportunities)
- ROI optimization

## Components

### 1. Code Quality Metrics
- Static analysis via ESLint and SonarQube
- IDE integration for live feedback

### 2. Error Resolution (Convergence)
- Runtime monitoring with detailed context
- Error patterns identification
- Automated diagnostics

### 3. Enhancement Identification (Divergence)
- Performance bottleneck detection
- Feature usage analytics
- User behavior insights

### 4. Retrospective Automation
- Automated reports on code quality
- Weekly/monthly retrospectives
- ROI calculation for improvements

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Error Resolution**:
   - Use the error resolution system when bugs are encountered
   - Follow the convergence pattern to quickly pinpoint issues
   - Document resolutions for future reference

2. **Enhancement Process**:
   - Review analytics data for enhancement opportunities
   - Prioritize based on ROI potential
   - Document decisions and implementation strategies

3. **Retrospectives**:
   - Weekly self-evaluation using the automated reports
   - Focus on both successes and areas for improvement
   - Use insights to guide next sprint planning
