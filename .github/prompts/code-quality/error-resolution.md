# Systematic Error Resolution Strategy

## Error Categorization by ROI Impact

1. **Critical (Highest ROI to fix)**
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data corruption issues
   - System outages
   - Revenue-blocking bugs

2. **High Priority**
   - TypeScript/type errors (prevent runtime failures)
   - User-facing functional bugs
   - Performance bottlenecks in critical paths
   - API contract violations

3. **Medium Priority**
   - Test failures
   - Code quality issues in frequently modified areas
   - Minor UI/UX inconsistencies
   - Non-critical deprecation warnings

4. **Low Priority**
   - Style guide violations
   - Documentation gaps
   - Technical debt in stable, rarely modified code
   - Minor console warnings

## Resolution Workflow

1. **Identify**: Use automated tools to detect issues (CI pipeline)
2. **Categorize**: Assign ROI impact category
3. **Prioritize**: Sort by ROI impact category, then by affected user count
4. **Resolve**: Fix issues following priority order
5. **Verify**: Ensure resolution with automated tests
6. **Track**: Monitor trends over time to identify systemic issues

## Resolution Guidelines by Issue Type

### TypeScript Errors

- Always fix type errors before runtime errors
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use union types instead of type assertions when possible

### ESLint Issues

- Focus first on rules that prevent bugs (no-unused-vars, no-undef)
- Then address maintainability issues (complexity, length)
- Finally address stylistic issues (if not automatically fixable)

### Test Coverage Gaps

- Prioritize coverage of:
  1. Core business logic
  2. Error handling paths
  3. Edge cases in frequently modified code
  4. API boundaries

### Security Issues

- Always fix:
  1. Authentication/authorization flaws
  2. Injection vulnerabilities
  3. Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
  4. Insecure data handling
