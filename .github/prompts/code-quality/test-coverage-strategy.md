# Test Coverage Strategy: Maximizing ROI

This document outlines our approach to test coverage with a focus on maximizing ROI by prioritizing tests that provide the most value in preventing costly bugs.

## Prioritized Testing Pyramid

### 1. High ROI Tests (Must Have)

- Unit tests for core business logic (revenue-related functions, pricing calculations)
- Integration tests for critical user flows (checkout process, authentication)
- Tests for previously-fixed bugs to prevent regressions
- Edge case tests for error-prone code areas

### 2. Medium ROI Tests (Should Have)

- Component tests for reusable UI elements
- API contract tests for external dependencies
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Cross-browser compatibility tests for key features

### 3. Lower ROI Tests (Nice to Have)

- Minor UI variants and styling
- Error messages and non-critical notifications
- Administrative features used infrequently
- Edge cases with minimal user impact

## Coverage Goals by Code Category

| Code Category | Min. Coverage | Justification |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Core business logic | 90% | Directly impacts revenue and user experience |
| API endpoints | 80% | External contract that must be maintained |
| UI components | 70% | Visual testing may be more efficient for some aspects |
| Utilities | 85% | Widely used across the application |
| Configuration | 50% | Often environment-specific |

## Test Quality Metrics

Coverage percentage alone doesn't ensure quality. Focus on these metrics:

1. **Mutation score**: Percentage of introduced bugs caught by tests
2. **Test fragility**: Frequency of test failures due to implementation changes
3. **Bug escape rate**: Bugs found in production vs. caught in testing

## ROI-Driven Testing Approach

### When to Write Tests

1. **Before fixing a bug**:
   - Write a failing test that reproduces the bug
   - Fix the bug until the test passes
   - This provides permanent regression protection

2. **During feature development**:
   - Write tests for critical paths and business logic first
   - Add edge case tests based on risk assessment
   - Consider postponing tests for low-risk areas

3. **During refactoring**:
   - Ensure high test coverage before significant refactoring
   - Use tests as a safety net for architectural changes

### When to Skip or Defer Tests

It's acceptable to have lower coverage in:

- Third-party library wrappers (already tested by the library)
- Rapidly evolving prototype code (tests would need frequent rewrites)
- Simple pass-through functions with minimal logic
- UI layout details better suited to visual testing

## Testing Tools Selection

Choose testing tools based on ROI:

- **Jest**: Fast, parallel unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing focused on user behavior
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing for critical user journeys
- **Lighthouse**: Automated performance, accessibility, and best practices

## Continuous Improvement

- Review test coverage metrics quarterly
- Identify areas where test gaps led to production issues
- Refine coverage goals based on actual bug data
- Automate testing as much as possible to reduce overhead
