## Development Iterations

### 1. Foundation Phase
- Establish core architecture and folder structure
- Implement essential utilities and components
- Set up monitoring infrastructure
- Create ROI analysis framework

### 2. Feature Implementation Phase
- Each feature must include:
  - Feature specification with ROI analysis
  - Component implementation with tests
  - Performance monitoring integration
  - Usage analytics tracking
  - Documentation updates

### 3. Refinement Phase
- Analyze real-world usage data
- Optimize performance based on monitoring
- Update ROI calculations with actual metrics
- Refactor based on identified patterns
- Document learnings for future iterations

## Code Standards

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **Variables**: camelCase
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix for interfaces
- **Functions**: camelCase verbs describing action

### Component Structure
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interface defined above component
- Logical grouping of related hooks and handlers
- Component-specific utilities defined outside component

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI behavior
- Integration tests for feature workflows
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all exported functions
- Purpose and usage examples for utilities
- Props documentation for components
- Known limitations and edge cases

### Feature Documentation
- ROI analysis and justification
- User story and acceptance criteria
- Technical implementation details
- Monitoring and analytics strategy

## Version Control Strategy

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/feature-name`: Feature development
- `bugfix/issue-number`: Bug fixes
- `release/version`: Release preparation

### Commit Standards
- Conventional commits format
- Link to ROI analysis or issue numbers
- Include before/after performance metrics when relevant

## Continuous Improvement

### Code Reviews
- Focus on ROI impact
- Performance and resource utilization
- Error handling and edge cases
- Adherence to architectural patterns

### Retrospectives
- Compare actual vs. estimated metrics
- Document learnings and improvement opportunities
- Update estimation models based on actual results
- Refine architectural decisions based on outcomes
