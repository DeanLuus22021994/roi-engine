## Technical Requirements

### ID Number Validation Rules

South African ID numbers follow the format `YYMMDD SSSS Z A C` where:

1. **YYMMDD**: Date of birth
   - Must be a valid date
   - Year is interpreted as 19YY for YYâ‰¥50 and 20YY for YY<50

2. **SSSS**: Gender sequence
   - 0000-4999: Female
   - 5000-9999: Male

3. **Z**: Citizenship
   - 0: SA Citizen
   - 1: Permanent Resident

4. **A**: Race (historical digit)
   - Now standardized as 8, but validation should accept any digit

5. **C**: Checksum digit
   - Calculated using the Luhn algorithm
   - Ensures integrity of the ID number

### Validation Process

1. Check length (must be exactly 13 digits)
2. Verify all characters are numeric
3. Validate date of birth
4. Verify citizenship digit (0 or 1)
5. Calculate and verify checksum using Luhn algorithm
6. Extract and format associated information

### API Integration

The application should support:

- Integration with Home Affairs verification API (future enhancement)
- Batch validation capability (future enhancement)

## ROI Justification

This application delivers high ROI through:

1. Reduction in manual data entry errors (estimated 15% reduction)
2. Faster processing of forms requiring ID validation
3. Decreased support requests related to ID validation issues
4. Improved user experience leading to higher completion rates

## Success Metrics

- 99.9% accuracy in ID validation
- User satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 or higher
- 20% reduction in form submission errors
- 15% improvement in form completion time
