# Biometrics Integration Specification

## Overview

This document provides detailed technical information on integrating biometric verification with South African ID validation, modernizing the approach from the original Windows Forms application while ensuring security, portability, and POPIA compliance.

## Biometric Modalities

The system supports multiple biometric verification methods that can be used independently or in combination:

1. **Fingerprint Recognition**
   - Support for optical, capacitive, and ultrasonic sensor types
   - ISO/IEC 19794-2 template format for interoperability
   - 1:1 verification against Home Affairs database (via secured API)

2. **Facial Recognition**
   - ISO/IEC 19794-5 compliant face image capture
   - Liveness detection to prevent presentation attacks
   - Anti-spoofing measures (blink detection, texture analysis)

3. **Voice Recognition** (Optional)
   - Text-dependent and text-independent verification
   - Noise cancellation and filtering
   - Language-agnostic processing for South Africa's 11 official languages

4. **Iris Recognition** (Optional, Future Enhancement)
   - ISO/IEC 19794-6 compliant iris image capture
   - High-security applications only
   - Specialized hardware requirements

## Architecture Components

### 1. Capture Subsystem

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
  - Vendor-agnostic API for biometric device access
  - Automatic device detection and configuration
  - Quality assessment during capture

- **Image Processing Pipeline**
  - Enhancement and normalization
  - Segmentation and feature extraction
  - Template generation

### 2. Matching Subsystem

- **Template Management**
  - Secure template storage with encryption
  - Tokenization for privacy protection
  - Template aging and update mechanisms

- **Matching Algorithms**
  - Score-based matching with configurable thresholds
  - Fusion of multiple biometric modalities
  - Adaptive thresholding based on quality metrics

### 3. Integration with ID Validation

- **Verification Workflow**
  - ID number validation as prerequisite for biometric verification
  - Biographic data matching (name, DoB from ID)
  - Comprehensive audit logging

- **Anti-fraud Measures**
  - Presentation attack detection
  - Multiple biometric factors for high-security operations
  - Behavioral anomaly detection

## Security and Privacy Considerations

### Biometric Data Protection

1. **Template Protection**
   - Irreversible template transformation
   - Cancellable biometrics support
   - No storage of raw biometric images

2. **Secure Storage**
   - Encrypted container for templates
   - Hardware security module integration where available
   - Segregation from biographical data

3. **Secure Processing**
   - Isolated container for biometric operations
   - Memory protection during processing
   - Zero-knowledge proof approaches for verification

### POPIA-Specific Requirements

1. **Explicit Consent**
   - Clear disclosure of biometric data usage
   - Purpose limitation statements
   - Right to refuse biometric processing

2. **Retention Policies**
   - Time-limited storage of templates
   - Immediate deletion when purpose fulfilled
   - Automated purging mechanisms

3. **Processing Limitations**
   - Processing only for specified verification purposes
   - Prohibition on template sharing without consent
   - Prevention of function creep

## Integration Methods

### 1. Software Development Kit (SDK)

```typescript
// Example SDK usage for fingerprint verification
import { BiometricVerifier } from '@sa-id-validator/biometrics';

// Initialize with security configuration
const bioVerifier = new BiometricVerifier({
  encryptionKey: process.env.BIO_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
  securityLevel: 'high',
  modalitiesRequired: ['fingerprint'],
});

// Perform verification
async function verifyIdentity(idNumber: string, fingerprintSample: Buffer) {
  // First validate ID number
  const idValidation = validateSAID(idNumber);
  
  if (!idValidation.isValid) {
    return { success: false, errors: idValidation.errors };
  }
  
  // Then verify biometrics
  const bioResult = await bioVerifier.verify({
    idNumber,
    biometricSample: fingerprintSample,
    modality: 'fingerprint',
    // Optional template to match against (if not using Home Affairs API)
    storedTemplate: storedTemplateBuffer,
  });
  
  return {
    success: bioResult.success,
    score: bioResult.score,
    confidence: bioResult.confidence,
  };
}
```

### 2. Containerized Service

The biometric processing is available as an isolated microservice with:

- REST API for verification requests
- gRPC interface for high-performance applications
- WebSocket support for real-time capture and feedback

### 3. Hardware Integration

- **Driver Management**
  - Automatic driver installation for supported devices
  - USB and network device discovery
  - Health monitoring and diagnostics

- **Certification Program**
  - Vendor certification for hardware compatibility
  - Performance benchmarking
  - Security assessment
