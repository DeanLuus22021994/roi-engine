# Next Steps for ROI Engine MVP

## 1. Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Write test cases for individual components and features.
  - Tool Recommendation: Jest, Mocha, or any framework suitable for your stack.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components work seamlessly together.
- **UI/UX Testing**: Verify light/dark mode functionality and overall design consistency.
- **Performance Testing**: Test for responsiveness and performance under expected load conditions.

## 2. Feedback Gathering

- **Internal Review**: Share the MVP with internal stakeholders for feedback.
- **User Testing**: Conduct testing with a small group of target users.
  - Focus on usability, functionality, and pain points.

## 3. Documentation

- **README Updates**: Ensure the README explains:
  - How to set up and run the MVP.
  - Key features and expected outcomes.
- **Technical Documentation**: Document the architecture and key decision points.
- **Roadmap**:
  - Outline future features and milestones.

## 4. Deployment

- **Hosting Platform**: Choose a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS).
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all sensitive information is managed securely.
- **Analytics Setup**: Integrate tools to track key metrics (e.g., Google Analytics).

## 5. Post-Deployment

- **Monitor Performance**: Track application uptime and user behavior.
- **Iterative Updates**: Use collected data and feedback to prioritize next development phases.
- **Marketing and Outreach**: Ensure stakeholders and users are informed about the MVP launch.
